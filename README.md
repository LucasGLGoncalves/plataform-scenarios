# 🌐 Terraform Platform Scenarios on DigitalOcean

This repository is intended as a sandbox for experimenting with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). It focuses on provisioning cloud infrastructure on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), including droplets and associated networking/firewall resources.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this project is to provide a practical environment to:

* Experiment with Terraform modules and syntax.
* Test infrastructure deployment strategies.
* Understand state management and output handling.
* Practice working with real-world cloud resources (DigitalOcean).

## 🔧 Requirements

* [Terraform CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) (>= 1.0)
* DigitalOcean account and API token
* SSH key added to your DigitalOcean account

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plataform-scenarios.git
cd plataform-scenarios
```

### 2. Configure Your Variables

Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` (or set as environment variables):

```hcl
DO_TOKEN     = "your_digitalocean_api_token"
SSH_KEY_NAME = "your_ssh_key_name_registered_on_digitalocean"
```

Alternatively, export them:

```bash
export TF_VAR_DO_TOKEN="your_digitalocean_api_token"
export TF_VAR_SSH_KEY_NAME="your_ssh_key_name"
```

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 4. Apply the Configuration

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt for confirmation before provisioning resources.

## 🌍 Resources Provisioned

### 🖥️ Droplet

* **Image**: Ubuntu 24.04 x64
* **Region**: `nyc2`
* **Size**: `s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb`
* **Backups**: Enabled (weekly, Tuesdays at 8 AM)
* **SSH Access**: Enabled via a pre-registered SSH key

### 🔒 Firewall

* **Inbound Rules**

  * TCP Port 22 (SSH) from anywhere
  * TCP Port 80 (HTTP) from anywhere
  * TCP Port 443 (HTTPS) from anywhere

* **Outbound Rules**

  * TCP Port 22 (SSH)
  * TCP Port 53 (DNS)
  * TCP Port 80 (HTTP)
  * TCP Port 443 (HTTPS)

---

## 📤 Outputs

After successful provisioning, Terraform will display:

```hcl
droplet_ip = "<public-ip-address>"
```

Use this IP to connect via SSH or deploy applications.

## 🧪 Experimental Nature

⚠️ This repository is for **educational and experimental purposes**. Resources created may incur costs on your DigitalOcean account.
